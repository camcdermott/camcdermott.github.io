	<h1>Excel-ent Spreadsheet Use</h1>
	
	<h2>Excel vs. Google Sheets</h2>
		<p>When I first began using spreadsheets, I took a course in my high school that covered Microsoft programs like Excel. This was my first exposure to the many offerings of Excel. I learned how conditional formatting, data filtering, and mail merge capabilities. While Excel was my introduction to the world of spreadsheets, I am less likely to use it compared to Google Sheets.</p>
		<p>One of the many great appeals of Google Sheets is the ability to limit cells. Microsoft Excel allows seemingly-endless scrolling to additional columns and rows, but Sheets allows users to set their preferences on total rows and columns. This makes information more visually appealing to me since I need not worry I'm not seeing all the data right away. Additionally, Sheets saves to the Cloud, which makes it easy to access from my phone or computer without worrying about flash drives or emailing the information to access across devices.</p>

	<h2>Suggested Spreadsheet Skills</h2>
		<p>I've developed many templates for spreadsheets that can eliminate communication issues and effectively illustrate trends in data. I believe there's a spreadsheet solution to almost every data problem, and the many functions of different spreadsheet programs create solutions and illustrations across fields. Of the spreadsheets I've created, the following are some of my favorite purposes:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Grade management tracker that calculates course grade, semester GPAs, and cumulative GPAs as points for each assignment are inputted</li>
			<li>Membership data tracker that measures total attendance based on each event, enrollment in communication platforms, and contact information</li>
			<li>Team workload management tracker that shows completion status, all assignments, and how soon tasks are due by department, rank, and name</li>
		</ul>
